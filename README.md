# Assessment Details
### Problem 1:
 Write a Python program that asks the user to enter an option to draw one of the two pictures shown below and then exit on click.  The program also exits when the user enters 3.  If the user enters an invalid option, an error message will be displayed and the menu will be shown again. You must apply the divide-and-conquer strategy by defining and calling relevant functions in your solution.

## Notice:
 Due to a communication issue on Canvas, a lot of students in this course have mistaken this for the official assignment while this is just a sample taken from previous semester. This is my implementation for the two problems mentioned in the sample assignment. Currently it has no optimizations and I have no plan to optimize the code due to time constraint and schoolwork.
